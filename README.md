# CLINICAL-TRIALS

#LONGITUDINAL DATA LEASPY ALZHEIMER DISEASE

#TP1 â€“ TP2 - TP3
We are using several linear regression model to see which one is the most suitable to describe the evolution of a disease compared to the model
used using the  librairry Leaspy predict the metabolomical activity of the putamen, a brain region that allowed tto monitor the advandcement of the Alzheimer's disease.


#MULTIVARIATE MODEL  CANCER

#PROJET CANCER
We are performing a multivariate linear regression  model using the module Lasso compare to the usual Linear 
Regression to see if we can reduce the features number that are used to carachterize  the model that predict  people's deathrate due to cancer.



#OMICS

#OMICS-1
We are trying to create a classsifiaction model  to predict lung cancer histology using patients
transcriptomic data (gene expression)

#OMICS-2
We are trying to create a classsifiaction model to predict 3-years survival of brain glioma patients using transcriptomes and methylomes
